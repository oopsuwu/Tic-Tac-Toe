# Tic-Tac-Toe
little tic tac toe game so i can get used to coding.

hello, i was watching a video waiting for my next class in the library and saw a video on coding a tic tac toe game. after watching the beginning portion i closed out of the video to see if i was able to finish it on my own. there it is.

i don't know what i can do to shorten most of the repetitive codes though. i sat there thinking for about an hour an had nothing which is pretty sad i know.
